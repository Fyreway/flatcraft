FlatCraft TODO:
~~- Debug chunk rendering~~
  ~~* Currently chunks render over each other, idk why~~
- World generation
  * Should be a 1d smooth noise function for terrain
  * Determines grass and dirt level
  * Stone goes from below the dirt to 0
  * Bedrock is only at 0
  * Hardcoded tree shape to save time, inserted at random intervals (OPTIONAL)
- Player inventory
  * See pre-classic rd-161348
  * No scrollbar to simplify input code
